COMMENT     REVIEWED REFSEQ: This record has been curated by NCBI staff. The
            reference sequence was derived from BC060802.1, DB073635.1,
            D28481.1, AC083855.3 and BM905371.1.
            Summary: Histamine is a ubiquitous messenger molecule released from
            mast cells, enterochromaffin-like cells, and neurons. Its various
            actions are mediated by histamine receptors H1, H2, H3 and H4. This
            gene was thought to be intronless until recently. The protein
            encoded by this gene is an integral membrane protein and belongs to
            the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. It mediates the
            contraction of smooth muscles, the increase in capillary
            permeability due to contraction of terminal venules, the release of
            catecholamine from adrenal medulla, and neurotransmission in the
            central nervous system. Multiple alternatively spliced variants,
            encoding the same protein, have been identified. [provided by
            RefSeq, Jul 2008].
            Transcript Variant: This variant (4), also known as H/I/K, differs
            in the 5' UTR compared to variant 1. Variants 1-4 encode the same
            protein.
            Sequence Note: This RefSeq record was created from transcript and
            genomic sequence data because no single transcript was available
            for the full length of the gene. The extent of this transcript is
            supported by transcript alignments.
            Publication Note:  This RefSeq record includes a subset of the
            publications that are available for this gene. Please see the Gene
            record to access additional publications.
