COMMENT     REVIEWED REFSEQ: This record has been curated by NCBI staff. The
            reference sequence was derived from U35315.1, AABR03124501.1,
            AABR03120814.1, AABR03120427.1, CB613191.1, CB784937.1, CB557712.1,

            Summary: Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), a neurotransmitter,
            elicits a wide array of physiological effects by binding to several
            receptor subtypes, including the 5-HT2 family of
            seven-transmembrane-spanning, G-protein-coupled receptors, which
            activate phospholipase C and D signaling pathways. This gene
            encodes the 2C subtype of serotonin receptor and its mRNA is
            subject to multiple RNA editing events, where genomically encoded
            adenosine residues are converted to inosines. RNA editing is
            predicted to alter amino acids within the second intracellular loop
            of the 5-HT2C receptor and generate receptor isoforms that differ
            in their ability to interact with G proteins and the activation of
            phospholipase C and D signaling cascades, thus modulating
            serotonergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system.
            Studies in rodents show altered patterns of RNA editing in response
            to drug treatments and stressful situations. [provided by RefSeq,

            Sequence Note: This RefSeq record was created from transcript and
            genomic sequence data because no single transcript was available
            for the full length of the gene. The extent of this transcript is
            supported by transcript alignments and orthologous data.

            publications that are available for this gene. Please see the Gene
