SJS. Description of files in alignments/


Overview
1. Files were created using amine_receptors/scripts/obtain_alignment.py. 
2. Files named nucleotide_XYZ correspond exactly to protein_XYZ (same ids, same seq order, same alignment, etc...). 
3. Files named the same but with .phy and .fasta extensions also the same, but phylip needed for RAxML input.

Alignment Files
1. {nucleotide/protein}_aln.{fasta/phy}        ->  alignment created with iterative strategy. all columns present.
2. {nucleotide/protein}_aln_masked.{fasta/phy} ->  alignment created with iterative strategy, and thus contains the same sequences as (1). Here, however, positions which do not agree with their column's domain consensus structure are masked with ?
3. {nucleotide/protein}_aln_naive.{fasta/phy}  ->  alignment which did not under iterative sequence removal. Contains a simple mafft alignment of ../{nucleotide/protein}_records.fasta

Misc Files
1. partitions.txt         ->  file for RAxML input (-q argument) giving the domain partitions. We use only two partitions, transmembrane and extramembrane
2. domain_consensus.txt   ->  string giving the consensus domain structure determined from the iterative alignment
3. domain_alignment.fasta ->  "protein" alignment created with iterative strategy but where residues have been replaced with OMI
