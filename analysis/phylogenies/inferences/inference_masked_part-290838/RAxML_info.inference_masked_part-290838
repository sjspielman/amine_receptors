IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences XP_005964416.1_XM_005964354.1 and XP_005908442.1_XM_005908380.1 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.


IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 10 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.


A mixed model file with model assignments for undetermined
columns removed has already been printed to  file /home/sjs3495/amine_data/partitions_consec.txt.reduced
Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates and undetermined columns removed is printed to file /home/sjs3495/amine_data/protein_aln_masked_consecpart.fasta.reduced

Alignment has 4049 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 91.46%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 2 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 1 inferences on the original alignment using 1 distinct randomized MP trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
ML estimate of 25 per site rate categories

Likelihood of final tree will be evaluated and optimized under GAMMA

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
