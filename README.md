## Quick links!
1. Structurally-informed, *unmasked* [protein MSA](./analysis/alignments/structural/protein_aln_struc.fasta) and [nucleotide MSA](./analysis/alignments/structural/nucleotide_aln_struc.fasta), both in FASTA format.
 
2. Structurally-informed, *masked* [protein MSA](./analysis/alignments/structural/protein_aln_struc_masked.fasta) and [nucleotide MSA](./analysis/alignments/structural/nucleotide_aln_struc_masked.fasta), both in FASTA format.

3. [ML partitioned-phylogeny](./analysis/phylogenies/final_trees/masked_part.tre) created with structurally-informed *masked* alignment, in newick format with branch lengths and bootstrap support.
